# Common Mistakes & Red Flags

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**

- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**

- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" is ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options (or 3 for detached HEAD)

**Cleaning up worktree for Option 2**

- **Problem:** Remove worktree user needs for PR iteration
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**Deleting branch before removing worktree**

- **Problem:** `git branch -d` fails because worktree still references the branch
- **Fix:** Merge first, remove worktree, then delete branch

**Running git worktree remove from inside the worktree**

- **Problem:** Command fails silently when CWD is inside the worktree being removed
- **Fix:** Always `cd` to main repo root before `git worktree remove`

**Cleaning up harness-owned worktrees**

- **Problem:** Removing a worktree the harness created causes phantom state
- **Fix:** Only clean up worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`

**No confirmation for discard**

- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**

- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Remove a worktree before confirming merge success
- Clean up worktrees you didn't create (provenance check)
- Run `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree

**Always:**

- Verify tests before offering options
- Detect environment before presenting menu
- Present exactly 4 options (or 3 for detached HEAD)
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only
- `cd` to main repo root before worktree removal
- Run `git worktree prune` after removal
